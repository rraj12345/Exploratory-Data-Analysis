Comprehensive data analysis of a kidney disease dataset. Here's a brief summary of the steps and findings 

Data Preprocessing
Reading the Data
The dataset is loaded and the initial rows are inspected to understand its structure. The id column is dropped as it is not necessary for analysis.

Data Cleaning
Renamed Columns: Column names were updated for better clarity and understanding.
Handled Erroneous Values: Unwanted or erroneous values in categorical columns were identified and replaced.
Data Type Conversion: Columns were converted to appropriate data types where necessary using pd.to_numeric.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Age Distribution: The age distribution is right-skewed, indicating a higher concentration of older individuals.

Visualization: Histogram or density plot.
Hypertension: Count of individuals with and without hypertension was visualized.

Visualization: Bar plot or count plot.
Blood Urea: A boxplot was created to compare blood urea levels between different classes (chronic disease vs. no chronic disease). Outliers are present in individuals with chronic disease.

Visualization: Boxplot.
Serum Creatinine: A violin plot was used to show the distribution of serum creatinine levels across different classes. Higher levels are associated with chronic disease.

Visualization: Violin plot.
Anemia: Count of individuals with and without anemia was visualized. Anemia is relatively rare in this dataset.

Visualization: Bar plot or count plot.
Appetite: A pie chart was created to show the proportion of individuals with a healthy vs. poor appetite. Most individuals have a healthy appetite.

Visualization: Pie chart.
Pus Cell Clumps: Count of individuals with and without pus cell clumps was visualized. Pus cell clumps are not present in most individuals.

Visualization: Bar plot or count plot.
White Blood Cell Count: A histogram was used to analyze the distribution of white blood cell counts.

Visualization: Histogram.
