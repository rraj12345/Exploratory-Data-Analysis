comprehensive data analysis of a kidney disease dataset. Here's a brief summary of the steps and findings 

Data Reading and Initial Inspection:

loaded the dataset and checked the first few rows.
Dropped the id column, which isnâ€™t necessary for analysis.
Data Cleaning:

Renamed columns for better understanding.
Identified and replaced unwanted or erroneous values in categorical columns.
Converted columns to appropriate data types using pd.to_numeric where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Age Distribution: The age distribution is right-skewed, indicating a higher concentration of older individuals.
Hypertension: Visualized the count of individuals with and without hypertension.
Blood Urea: Created a boxplot to compare blood urea levels between different classes (chronic disease vs. no chronic disease). Observed that outliers are present in individuals with chronic disease.
Serum Creatinine: Used a violin plot to show the distribution of serum creatinine levels across different classes. Higher levels are associated with chronic disease.
Anemia: Visualized the count of individuals with and without anemia. Anemia is relatively rare in this dataset.
Appetite: Created a pie chart to show the proportion of individuals with healthy vs. poor appetite. Most individuals have a healthy appetite.
Pus Cell Clumps: Count of individuals with and without pus cell clumps was visualized. Pus cell clumps are not present in most individuals.
White Blood Cell Count: Used a histogram to analyze the distribution of white blood cell counts.
